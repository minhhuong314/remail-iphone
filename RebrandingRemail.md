A couple of things I'd ask you to do:
  1. Include a copy of [this notice](http://code.google.com/p/remail-iphone/source/browse/notice.txt) on your product website (similar to [the notice on the reMail HP](http://www.remail.com/terms_oss.html))
  1. Please include credit like "Based on reMail, an open source project by Google, Inc." somewhere inside the product (right now it's in `AboutViewController`)
  1. In Xcode, do an Edit > Find > Find in Project, and search for "support@yourcompany.com". Replace each occurrence with your support email address.
